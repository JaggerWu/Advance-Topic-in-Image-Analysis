---------------------------------

[Advanced topics in Image Analysis](http://kurser.ku.dk/course/NDAK15013U) is one course about fashional and classical methods solving computer vision tasks in [University of Copenhagen](http://www.ku.dk). Consist of three main parts(Segmentation, Objection Recognition, 3D vision) in Computer Vision.
 
- [Segmentation Based on Meanshift](https://github.com/JaggerWu/Advance-Topic-in-Image-Processing/tree/master/Segmentation)
- [Objection Recognition(mainly based on CNN)](https://github.com/JaggerWu/Advance-Topic-in-Image-Processing/tree/master/Object_Recognition)
- [3D vision](https://github.com/JaggerWu/Advance-Topic-in-Image-Processing/tree/master/3D%20Vision)
